Honestly, most of the people who’d end up here would probably push the close button without delay. Well, that’s intentional from my side at least. The design philosophy of the website would seem quite obsolete for most people. Also, there are no images, verbose proses, and many topics are off the trends, et cetera. Well, the thing is – this is not a commercial website.


The aim of the site is to serve as a preface of me to those people who even carry a single interest in either connecting with me or knowing me more (perhaps in the truest sense). This is not a portfolio. It is much more than that. 



TALKING ABOUT THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES, let me expand upon the core ones:
-	Verbosity: The site is so verbose. I mean not tags, no flying colors, images, flowcharts. Just a bit of animation and articles. The sole reason for this is to anchor only those who are truly ‘interested’ in knowing me rather than passing a superficial judgment. The world is now a commonplace. Hundreds of developers, online, presenting their portfolio thru an array of applications or websites. All of ‘em seek to do just one task– IMPRESS. Not to present one’s true image but rather build one which is most of the time, fake. Have you surfed across LinkedIn and read the overly decorated language of the commonplace? If not, you’re lucky, and on the right path. Dare not to go that way. If yes, you know what I am saying. As Byung-Chul Han roughly spoke of, they seek to build their exhibition value.

-	Philosophical and Poetical Tone: Philosophy naturally comes to me, either due to my religious nature, love for stories, and ‘morals’ or my personality. Therefore, most of the time, while discussing things, I end up presenting their implications in a philosophical sense. You, while reading thru my articles, would encounter various such instances. Bear with me, however, and try to dive into the implications of what I’m speaking about. 

-	Moreover, you’ll often encounter allegorical language, metaphors, and even some lyrical sense. Collectively, you’ll encounter poetic language. It’s natural to me. Bear with it.

-	A Reflection: Tho the site contains a philosophical and reflective tone; you’ll encounter the language to be informal in many senses. However, it is not my universal way of writing. In fact, most of the time, my language is formal and poetic. However, I’ve reserved this site for some crude, informal, and genuine presentation and reflection of my thoughts. Probably you can follow my Medium or Substack handle to read more formal things from me.

-	The dearth of visual elements and a default dark theme: I don’t think that if you’ve read it till here, the dearth of visual elements bugs you much. As I explained in the first point, it is intentional. The dark theme just adds to on it. Nothing much to explain here.


Well, that’s how this site is. Would be happy if you loved it or if some points resonated with you as well. In a world where the COMMON SENSE leads personal convictions, let there be people like us, who, even if the wind blows against them stand firmly for what they consider true.Originality could save the world.
