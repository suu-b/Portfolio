Technology is quite a broad term, especially to fit for this section. To me, the term was always the representation of the modern appliances; those which’ve either made life overly leisured or those which’ve opened a portal for humanity to a higher realm. The former kind of appliances – of leisure and laziness, not a big fan of 'em. And I wouldn’t like to talk about them either. They kinda bug me. Humorously, a good discussion about both kinds would be beyond the scope of the section (maybe of the site too). The latter kind – those which’re the doors to a higher realm, in my eyes lie in Artificial Intelligence and this term has recently begun to attract my eyes. Earlier, it too bugged me as it all appeared an exaggerated concept. But as I magnified into it through some articles, philosophers, or chapter 1 of Russell and Norvig’s book, it fascinated me.

But this bubble of narrowing technology to a few modern appliances is broken now. I’ve come to realize that technology was always with humanity. The application of the contemporary span of human knowledge is what technology is. So, even a stone axe is a technology and so is a quantum computer. It's fascinating that we’re keeping two such extreme things on one scale and importantly, equal.

But my discussion is not about this too. It is about a specific field that emerged as Al-Khwarizmi produced algorithms, Babbage produced his analytical engine, Ada wrote the very first program and Turing founded it, the topic of my discussion, Computer Science.

### Computer Science
A fairly new concept it is in terms of age, but widespread and has even caused the extinction of many old institutions. Originally, computers started as mere tools of calculation as Pascal invented Pascaline for his accountant father. But now, they’re everywhere, literally.

When I was in the 3rd grade, my father bought me a computer (due to my repeated insistence). That whole lucky night went into an exploration of this newly arrived machine. The following days? In playing road rash and a golf game. But I was exposed to a powerful thing. Not to forget the fact that though it was fascinating, I never actually planned or thought to build a career in this field. And now here I am pursuing a degree in it.

Now it is the time that we realize the world is really at a pivot (or maybe we have already passed it), as it was when the age of enlightenment had ushered. And computer science, the progeny of mathematics and science, is its precursor. I’ve had a great discussion on this here.

Computer scientists are the noble people who bear the torch. And so, being a student of this field really materializes a purpose for me.  



### Software Engineering
Software Engineering is a subset of computer science. Broadly, whatever computer science ideates is on the shoulders of engineers to realize or at least classify as possible. So, the field, to me feels kinda the practical face. Therefore, it involves things like website and applications development, programming, networking, data management, operating system engineering, and performance management et cetera. 

I like creating things. From the initial ideation, management, gathering resources, starting out with the project, pushing it to completion, and eventually, seeking improvements. Flexible deadlines would be a cherry on the top.

Although I stumbled across the degree without any planning, it feels great or at least satisfactory. And favorite part is that the degree has brought me the power to materialize most of the software projects I can think of. Take, for instance, an example of the website. Without the knowledge of web development, I won’t be able to bring my preface to the internet (although there are various no-code alternatives, I won’t have such control as I bear here).
