Earlier, I was a smart kid but naïve, sincere but mediocre, to sum up– something crude. I am still crude, lesser though, but at least, I realize that. Now, everything seems to fall in place – not the whole life but a sense of purpose. I am grateful for this. I can spend years writing like this about me or probably philosophizing, after all, I am a writer; however, for the sake of your ease, let me list all that is me. Interests are a great representation of one’s personality. Thus, let me list what I am. You can follow any card to dive into my takes, aspirations, and/or my progress in each of my interest fields:";
