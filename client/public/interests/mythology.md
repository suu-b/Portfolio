Since childhood, I’ve adored the idea of hearing and narrating stories. Most of the stories I’ve heard have left an indelible mark on me – residing somewhere either in my stories, my philosophies, or my attitude. Especially those who bear a fantastic touch - something which appears natural but isn’t. I’m not a big fan of stories that make complete sense scientifically; I do not hate them, but just I’m on the neutral side. 


Mythology falls in such a category of fantastic touches. Myth, though the word means that ITS FALSE, sometimes to me, seems way deeper than the truths, especially belonging to the modern world (Nietzsche would hate me for this). This debate on Myths is a historical one, for instance, consider Plato: he appeared to be quite an enemy of the poets. His criticism of poetry and dramas seemed trenchant. He believed that myths shape the culture. Therefore, in an ideal state (as one he created in Republic) should’ve them banned, or at least, the myths should be highly regulated and pruned of any possible youth-corrupting aspect. Xenophanes of Colophon, one of the Pre-Socratics, too criticized myths. He was famously targeted the very conception of GODs. His quote would make things clear:


*Mortals consider that gods are born and they have clothes and speeches similar to them and bodies like them. The Ethiopians believe that Gods are dark skinned while the Thracians believe that Gods have blue eyes and red hair. But if cattle or horses had the hands to draw, they would have drawn forms of God as horses and cattle like cattle.*




At some point in my life, my views resonated with Euhemerus a lot. He ideated that the gods (or by extension all the super beings) were terrestrial beings roaming on Earth like us. They endowed humanity with immortal gifts and honors. Stories of them were told retold, deliberated, exalted by poets, and eventually ended up being myths. Allegory is another idea that fits well with Euhemerism – that the myths are allegories and metaphors containing some profound truths and ideas inspiring humanity to live and strive.


Fontenelle, a thinker from the Renaissance, provided a more pragmatic (I won’t say logical or scientific) explanation of the origin of Myths. He ideated those myths originated as a reaction of early humans to the natural environment and its happening. So, to explain the world in some logical (and understandable) light. This is another profound characteristic of humans. They cannot bear randomness and seek to look for consistency or explanations. Yet, the modern age is depriving us of such a feature (Irony it is). 


However it is - true or untrue. For me myths – from the Orient or Western, they’re a tender pillow, a light, a lesson. Therefore, a mix of Euhemerism, Allegory, and Fontenelle’s attempt has stuck with me and thus, shaped my viewpoints.
